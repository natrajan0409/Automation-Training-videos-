WEBVTT

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:01.740
Yeah.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.100
So let's revise the concepts which we discussed in the section.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.340
OK.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.930
So first thing to start with is the actual glass.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.200
So when do we actually use actual glass.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.880
Basically if you want to move your miles or particular you that's all.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.150
I just want to look at it the whole way.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:37.830
Then we use actions glass and we like a Mansingh actually an object but actually just says in the letter

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.560
which you have given of the corrections then you say a lot more to an element of that delegation of

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.750
that element.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.810
Bar b don't perform OK.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:56.380
This step will make as to move our mouse to that revolution over on it.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.910
Which we have discussed in the program right.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.160
So again mouseover actions can perform using actual glass.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:14.010
And if you want the right click anywhere then that can be performed using contextually like in this

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.470
instance.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:25.590
Actually that can be performed using actions glass and Dragon or you can drag and drop it on either

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.810
place using actions glass and you can double click on it.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.400
OK so even you can write that things in capital letters for example.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.860
You need to enter some variant gaps.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.200
OK so you use actions class to write it in caps.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.570
And this giving over of you on top of it if you are going deep neck or foam at the back to my leg and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.450
see the hole really in real examples.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:05.720
OK I'm just giving now or feel like just I used a dancing in real bubbles like how you handle your right

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.810
only using actual glass.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.380
So how you enter information gaps using action glass I will double click I will drag and drop.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.790
So all these mouse interactions like digging and gaps are getting on right.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.750
We know you can do with an action case.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.510
OK.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.270
Next the most famous interrogation.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.400
Hold your hand in my stipple windows in selenium the driver.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:33.890
OK.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:43.500
By the find their driver can understand only the parent browser which is actually in vogue when starting

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.750
the program.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:52.170
So I'm clicking each other and again open so that Trevor will not have an outlet in the window which

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.060
is opened in our other window again.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:05.340
So you need to find or if you need to specify that they were saying the switch to that window that the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:14.330
command you use is tiler door switch to door window off just about a metre of of that window.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.340
OK.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.940
It just like allah allah dislikes Risto of bingo.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:28.830
The challenge here is how do you get the idea of that other window from that to come and what you need

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.980
to use this driver door get window handles get window.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:43.950
And this is the method which will give you all of those which are open and their IDs OK throw them into

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.630
the send them into the list data structure.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:57.050
And if you want to go a second window into Haiti and then grabbing that elite and put it in or switch

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:03.540
the window off that bottom with a blessing in that perimeter and everyone understands that OK I need

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.990
to switch to this one though.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.870
How would you say it was for Windows that I really am to successfully navigate that.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.130
So and then you can perform your operations as usual.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.620
And then once operations are complete they come back again to bed and when the you need to the spacing

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:31.320
says two dark window parent window 80 you can get that in the list by dousing place that window 80 here

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.790
and get back to that.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.430
So this is really collapsing if you're practically going what's the electricity doing today.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.970
OK.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.260
So basically what we use here is switch to vendor get into hander's.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.110
These two are very important.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.210
OK.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:56.300
So that's what a person can expect you to tell when they ask how do you handle multiple windows.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.020
Right.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.540
The next frames these are the most important.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.400
And I as I said in my previous actions that I do this.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:11.180
I frame and frames it in these to check for these two tag names and an obligation.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.450
If you're fine then the application have frames.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.450
So how do you find that by bag name ivory or white or black mainframes and you'll that you'll get the

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.180
count and based upon that you can come to a basic conclusion saying how many principles into an application

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.730
.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.360
Ok then same as alert.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:36.230
And Windows never got switched to frame off the frame of index.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.100
You can switch to that frame.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:46.170
And what Tony and come back saying they went door to door defined and then please remember you need

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:52.540
to come back again normal even when those friends that you need to use the command see.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.630
So it's too dark defined.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.250
And then OK.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.430
So what's the lecture that if you aren't the more experienced and this big and one practical example

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.380
so Gombak agonising and if I can then and.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:16.770
That's how you handle frames What can you expect the minimum to focus on the section saying how do you

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.920
handle your reg information gaps or how to handle multiple windows and how to handle frames.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.280
These are very very famous in the recursions and straightforward law.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:34.640
And then overland from ASM or in an overview in the how and what I said now in the day after show an

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:42.240
echo or just go through the letters of this you have a basic idea and practice one of two of them were

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.760
practising Manado of obligations on the net and you'll get a hundred percent confidence in the section

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.120
.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.290
OK.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.180
Yeah that's it for now.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:07:01.440
And we'll go to the other famous in directions which might be asked to use There's miscellaneous concepts

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.650
.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.110
Let's let them.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.980
OK.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.380
So that's over now.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.010
Thank you
