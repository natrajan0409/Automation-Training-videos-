00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.330
Your Sony I have to restart my lips.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:14.090
So let's say I'm just now I'm too old for this occasion.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.740
So I agreed to stay.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.580
Windows will become used

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:31.480
as legend with a single window.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.690
Right.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:41.370
So rather got open and we are landing on Google sign a page and we clicked on link

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.780
and it's not really in the other window

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.380
the window was OK.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.290
Yeah.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.040
So now go to the output and see before switching.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.580
I have given this data instead.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.370
It says Create your own.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.760
Is my of the window are switching.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.190
And now you'll see the table it says right.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.310
Google asks for your information center.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.330
That means we have successfully switched from on Barrington's.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.560
So that's the reason you are seeing variation in the same letter but different outputs because they

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.620
have begun to happen by these steps which during the off time Id.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.380
OK.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.440
So now you have to say we going to work as usual but under a train window you can go ahead and Spiderman's

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.610
click on the links.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.290
OK.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:52.540
So all the operations were getting back from us and this step will be an event as far that only.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.110
Again if you're trying to find something better in Windows 80 now it won't go up because now isn't changing

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.580
in all.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.520
So if you go back to bed and we know again you have to sit back and unless you sense you cannot overcome

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.120
your bed and we don't know.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.530
So now the selenium knows only that you are on the window shade window.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.720
You wonder how many mortifications one of the operations here and tile window.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.190
Let's do something.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.860
I want to get back to grade your table again.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.680
OK.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:45.480
So I just switch back into my bed and driver door switch door window.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.230
So this time I get my bearings.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:03:00.110
OK we got Ben and any day in the office I'm just passing in there and if I say get tangled again but

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.180
this time when I shouldn't be there you are legally OK first.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.860
OK.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.090
I like some kind of debugger here for kind of clarity.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.890
Just

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.250
before switching.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:23.280
OK

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.060
.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.000
So I did say you're to perform all the operations whatever you want to take the window just what.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.630
Same the same Lettermen that.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.260
No I'm just showing how again the night.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.820
And now

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:07.400
of the switching and switching back to bed one from this.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.750
Finally and see this

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:23.610
you have begun to see that OK let's concentrate on Consolo before switching and creating your Google

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.340
account.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.320
So after thing I was watching it fight a grass fire Information Center and switching back to Baron and

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.800
again in translating your Google ever day.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.770
OK.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.230
So that's how you walk by switching multiple windows with selenium.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.990
So that's it half of this lecture.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.100
And the window handles session.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.970
Thank you.
