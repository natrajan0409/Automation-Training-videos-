00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:08.050
So first you mean to say try what are fun get me and all the windows.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.770
OK.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:16.930
Just wanted to ask Elenium Let's get me the all of windows available which also is governed by the driver

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.130
.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.660
So then the command card gate window handles against the window.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.780
It will read and handle any.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.240
OK.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.150
There are more than one window handy Lady Lady you can get window handles so it will give you all the

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.430
window.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.070
Windows 8 is OK with this.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.190
Do you see the date time expecting as set of springs.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.670
If there are more than one window and the other three.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.350
OK.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.540
You'll have to explain the set of three strings.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.390
Each link is and will handle any Ok even though it will really three window handy ladies.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.270
So this is under fire please.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.780
OK well we've been enjoying it since I live in diet and exercise every day.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.780
There are three windows open.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.960
So this get rid of the ladies first.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:24.220
This mother and this unit are stored in the same day as Dr. King that's for the US and this group came

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:34.300
here with a set set of strings and they will dig into the the.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.600
Them.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.860
So this command will bring all the windows open and it blows and do.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:50.640
I always say now for example that's how I go how the set will be stored

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.560
here.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.500
So again this is Windows 8.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.170
Yeah.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.300
So now if I said I zoom lenses instead.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:17.960
And when I get strings string handling is so fast build the store here on the first column.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.060
First Basket the second one is in the second row.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.820
And third one is darker.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.480
OK.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.270
One two three four four six eight is a half.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.840
When asked what they mean to say this will restore the optimises first converso one two three four.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.310
And now that's four way down here.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:48.330
And the name of this and this is what if I won in the first I'll be the first to say when and when I

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.290
will be stopped by the fire because that is the Windows girl very initially.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.530
So when I say get real don't hand this.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.940
And when installing the say in the parent window I deal with it and in the second column the immediate

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.000
window got open from betting window will be dead and the third column.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.700
The second table got very well with it and subsequently continues.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.310
So it comes on faster.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.390
So first of all of any it does matter.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.260
First identify the better installs in the first place and then simply change next blessed and next subsequent

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.030
list.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.900
Now in our case we have only two ways.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.280
When I read this common one is betting and others take this change.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.700
So only do we know how long the line is we get any store in this way.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.530
Why when it's here and when is he.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.560
OK.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.890
So keep that in mind.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.240
We have now lost with two.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.350
Eight is one is bad and another is insane.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:05.250
Now I want to get this take the 80 I'm basically extracted.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.120
Oh my get.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:14.060
Why am I doing about 80 of them knows when I want to just switch to that change window.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:24.330
Ok firstly we pop that and I come back opposite driver door swings open up if you want to switch to

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.320
the other window from your bedroom window.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.420
You have to switch to dark window.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.940
OK.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.210
So what do I need to switch that particular idea or that window.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:46.320
The Handy lady you need to pass as an argument to this window in there so that when you hear the stair

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:54.960
switch to window or wherever you'd find that to get to that window drivable switched and U.S.-Indian

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.660
will find that by the Lecce window.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.300
OK.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.940
That all happens when you pass the ID into this document.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.750
So it's simple it's a single step.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:14.580
There are verses that we know that's a tantalizing party and I do that really don't mean that that's

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:23.460
intolerance for dogma but these get go ahead and give us all the easy to obey by the selenium and asked

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.710
on the same day.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:33.860
And maybe we know the story in the first row and my chain is in second.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.140
OK.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.820
So the second row in this country is in two Golden Globes and the just like to say name is what we have

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.110
you in 80.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:49.340
Now I want to come to this place and get this ID and I should place here.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.050
So that's the only thing I need to do.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.960
So then my desk is just on the window.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.970
I have to balance the and get this in place.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:06.810
So how can it travels to this place to say that there is an encore.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.140
It says ideas.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.700
OK this is an on set name and I start.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:21.270
You say you get something like this it can be that it can be done to the steps in this and you get it

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.390
there rest of my people will say that I started with the help of the narrator.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.750
And damn I'm a writer so let's see how can we do that.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.610
Great.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.640
And even though she's expecting I was trying.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:42.510
So whatever it is expecting just place it in the reference and then say

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:52.640
to daughter don't get find by saying or God Bless.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.080
It's very simple.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.780
We just got to the window and they said no we are reading the of the radio.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:09.580
And USAID the my name as like OK now by default this idea object will be on the top here.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:18.580
So now today if you want to go to the fastest way and to get better and really doily that is faster

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:24.270
all you need to say I do our next.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.150
OK.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:30.240
So when Nick said this day it will come to the festival.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.330
And it really grabbed the ighly.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.530
OK.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.780
Place it in.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:45.200
If you say I did our mix will be here in the grabbing any place it in the string.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:45.880
Right.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:54.290
Let me get a better indictees with me because my gondola is here now.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:08:00.360
I'm interested in getting to the 80 degrees I want to know one more next.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:00.860
That's all.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.690
You just said I did it again next.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.980
If you say next again it will come down on Mr..

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.040
That's all you need to keep on saying I did.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:14.390
Next day you'll find your Accelerando.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:21.640
So here it is in second place I just get two days in prison first place decided on from the and what's

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:22.400
the cost.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.570
But here I am interested in the second child window in motion.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.990
Do I did not off the next second.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:34.010
And this is my desired Child ID.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.500
OK.

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:37.230
That's it.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:44.070
I got my really into this video with the help of the director and now I read this the

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:56.070
driver door swings two window Chailly.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:56.830
OK.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:05.730
I will place here and now he pulls out this release ledge and broad from bed and that this child I.D.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.220
and now I bring down the baby.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.440
And now we have to see there.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.960
I believe it was something like White will kill us.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.700
For you information as sign.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.680
OK.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.460
So this is what I am expecting.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.490
Right over the top.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.330
Get it in

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:28.420
.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.430
So let me run this.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:39.860
So now before switching gets great you will get it on right now.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:49.060
Let's run this and see what cranes and it does an arm can then take it.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:56.250
This is something we need to restart on it gives to us we're going to bring this give me a minute to

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.510
