00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.950
Yeah.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.940
So these are a few more questions you need to know before we actually get into the cause.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.270
So first how to communicate with the trainer for queries.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.400
This is most important question which everyone wants to know and the last lecture I have clearly explained

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.750
that we provide lifetime instructors support.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.740
But in what manner.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.960
Like how there wasn't a communication channel established between a student and a trainer.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.290
I'll show you that in this lecture.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.580
Right.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.180
So let's say you are watching this lecture.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.130
This is Daba installations the action to lecture when you're going to this lecture you got stuck and

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.360
you need to clear that information before you proceed.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.270
OK.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.260
But that just go and click HERE browse Scotian and dancers button.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.680
So when you click that the cushions window will get open.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.600
So before you post the question you can check from the list of cautions available here.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.540
These are already asked by the previous students.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.800
Maybe you or dope may get clarified by going through discussions.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.310
If not you may start asking a new question.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.550
So let's say I'll just click on this.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.060
Maybe you are not sure about the operating system which your system is on something like that a click

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.800
is and here you say which one to select for 32 bit operating system.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.310
Then you can see that depends on what machine you have.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:45.720
If you have data do it's a kind of replay you got and senting if you go through these let's say they

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.890
looking for that little bit.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:54.450
And actually he is not finding that so I have provided him the link to download the 32 bit and he said

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.210
thank you.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.490
So that's how basically students ask the questions and I reply here in this window pane.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.890
OK so let's say that the push in which you want to ask is not present in the list of these are you'd

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.010
start typing.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.970
Maybe you are not so sure about environment variable setting in Java.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.140
Then type in read on and when you are typing.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.270
You'll see that questions are related to your dome's are displaying.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.260
If it doesn't display then go ahead and take this but I'm asking you a question.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.770
OK so when you collect this you will have the text where you can enter your information and post Khashan

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.190
.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.150
So I will be notified when you click on this post.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.700
Question.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.980
So then I log back into my account and write the replay for it.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.940
OK so that's all we communicate.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:56.550
If the answer was not satisfied or if we are not satisfied with the explanation I have provided in terms

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:04.980
of text then we are introducing a On-Demand Skype sessions on weekends where we actually invite you

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.260
to decide Skype session and you could directly ask our friends.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.220
So as I said we have set of five people who are working to just solve student queries.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.600
So if you are not satisfied with the answer provider as in this forum we will directly interact with

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.670
you and solve the question in the Skype session.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.030
OK we have that flexibility but we do that only on the weekends.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.050
We really should use up our timings and let you in on that.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.930
OK so that's how you could ask the question and get answer.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.710
Once I get replaced you will get modified again.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.950
You can go through it and check for answer.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.090
So most probably 99 percent all your queries will be solved in that discussion but only in some cases

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.080
where you are not satisfied with dancer.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.740
We could take one more step ahead and read in live interaction so that you can browse the question and

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.770
answer and the next.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:07.140
If you see that wheels are blurry go to sitting here and make sure you are on 720 pixels so that will

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.860
make use a bright video.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.340
And if you feel that if you don't download this lecture just go ahead and click on download downloaded

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.870
.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.600
This option may not be available for all the latest.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.020
I have not enabled those for every lecture so most of the collectors have this option where you can

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.700
go ahead and download it.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:33.270
OK and if you want to watch de-selected later point of time you could go ahead and say add bookmarks

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.170
so that it will be Mondas your favorite
